Causal determinism is the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature. The idea of determinism is ancient, however, it gained prominence in the 18th century which lead to a lot of mathematical analysis. Determinism in essence is deeply connected with our understanding of the world through the lens of the physical sciences and their explanatory ambitions on the one hand and the philosophical question of free will on the other. In both these general areas, there is no consensus on if the idea of determinism holds true, or of its implications either way. I wanted to explore the idea of determinism in detail.

## Definition 
A more recent practice in philosophy is to distinguish views and theories of what causation is from what any of its conclusions are about success and failure. Following this practice, I will stick to the idea of determinism instead of causal determinism.
There are many imprecise definitions about the idea of determinism (which isn't necessarily a problem unless it's being used to analyze a specific subsystem or if we think about it in a specific theoretical construct). However, this definition by the Encylopedia of Philosophy appears all-encompassing (at least according to me):

> Determinism: The world is governed by (or is under the sway of) determinism if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time t, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law.

The encyclopedia goes on to give precise definitions of the world, what governing means, and what natural law is. But for this blog post, we can borrow their definitions from science (which although isn't all-encompassing for philosophy but is enough as a working definition). 

The definition is quite interesting as it's roots lie in a fundamentally scientific idea which is everything can. in principle, be explained and everything that exists has sufficient reason for being and for being exactly as is and not otherwise. This idea was first named by Leibniz as the Principle Of Sufficient Reason. Since all physical theories have a deterministic trait, the idea of Principle Of Sufficient Reason is implied in any physical sciences.

## My Thoughts
Due to the overwhelming success of the idea, philosophers tend to believe in the truths of deterministic doctrines. There is also a tendency among people to confuse determinism with fate and predictability.

Predictability and Determinism are easy to disentangle unless there is theology involved. The idea of Laplace's demon shows that these two ideas can comingle. To quote Laplace:

We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it, nothing would be uncertain, the future, as well as the past, would be present to its eyes. The perfection that the human mind has been able to give to astronomy affords but a feeble outline of such an intelligence.

This argument is deeply rooted in the idea of theology and it is quite likely that Laplace had God in mind when he said spoke of the "intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature". However, the 19th and 20th century works in simulating dynamical systems have shown that neither a finite nor an infinite computer is capable of predicting the future given the current state of the system. This is because it is not possible to predict the future of most systems as they heavily rely on the initial condition (the three-body problem being the simplest of them all and chaos theory being the field under which these investigations occur). So, there are many subsystems where despite knowing everything about these systems, we cannot predict their future whereas there are systems in our world where predicting the future is trivial. So, determinism and predictability don't seem to be connected by a logical thread after all.

Fatalism is the idea that all events are predetermined and are destined to occur no matter what we do. Advocates of fatalism tend to believe that the guarantor of fate is either the action of God or some other aspect relating to divinity rather than the unfolding of events in a highly non-linear dynamical system. The idea of Fatalism is separable from the idea of determinism because one can distinguish between gods and mythical forces from the natural/causal laws (although this can get tricky at times depending on the metaphysical argument being made about what/who the guarantor of the fate is). Simply put, one idea believes that certain things are fated to happen without any involvement of deterministic laws whereas the other idea believes that the world is governed by deterministic laws with nothing left to fate. This also means (loosely speaking) that given all events in the past, all future events are already destined to occur.

Determinism and predictability are façon de parler at best with determinism explaining what is at stake. In Laplace's demon, a sufficiently bright demon born a hundred years before I did with the knowledge of how things stood in the world can determine my every action and is capable of predicting every action I take and the moves I make like one does when a marionette dances to the tugs of the strings. Depending on how our lives are going, we either like the idea of being marionettes or we can't stand it. It doesn't matter if this demon (or God) that is capable of prediction. What is alarming is that far past states of our world are determining our every move. Well, I'll end this post here as it is getting into ideas such as the existence of free will (which I hope will be a thought experiment for some other post).
