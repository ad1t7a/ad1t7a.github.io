I'm like building machines that learn to move like humans. My current goal is to solve robotic grasping and manipulation of any object, anywhere, faster than people. My interests lie in motion planning and control of robotic systems. This is a personal website where I post my weekend exploits, most of which are unrelated to robotics. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any of my posts/projects and would like to learn more.
